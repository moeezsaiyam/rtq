Yet many of us miss prayers during the day -- sometimes for unavoidable reasons, sometimes due to negligence.  Of course one should try to pray within the specified times. There is wisdom in the Islamic prayer schedule, setting times throughout the day to \"take a break\" to remember God\'s blessings and to seek His guidance.  If a prayer is missed, it is common practice among Muslims that it is to be made up as soon as it is remembered or as soon as one is able to do so. This is known as Qadaa\'. For example, if one misses the noon prayer because of a work meeting that could not be interrupted, one should pray as soon as the meeting is over. If the next prayer time has already come, one should first perform the prayer that was missed, and immediately after it the “on time” prayer.  It is incorrect to simply throw up one’s hands and say, “Oh, it was missed and there is nothing to do about it.” There are times when prayer is missed for unavoidable reasons. It is indeed a sin if one misses prayers regularly without a valid reason (i.e. constantly oversleeping the pre-dawn prayer). However, the door to repentance is open and the first step is to make up the missed prayer as soon as possible.

The direction of the qiblah is also often marked in the front of the mosque with an ornamental indentation in the wall, known as a mihrab.  It should be noted that Muslims do not worship the Ka\'aba.

Already during the early Muslim caliphates, first the Arabs, then the Persians and later the Turks set about to create classical Islamic civilization. Later, in the 13th century, both Africa and India became great centers of Islamic civilization and soon thereafter Muslim kingdoms were established in the Malay-Indonesian world while Chinese Muslims flourished throughout China. Islam is a religion for all people from whatever race or background they might be. That is why Islamic civilization is based on a unity which stands completely against any racial or ethnic discrimination. Such major racial and ethnic groups as the Arabs, Persians, Turks, Africans, Indians, Chinese and Malays in addition to numerous smaller units embraced Islam and contributed to the building of Islamic civilization. Moreover, Islam was not opposed to learning from the earlier civilizations and incorporating their science, learning, and culture into its own world view, as long as they did not oppose the principles of Islam. Each ethnic and racial group which embraced Islam made its contribution to the one Islamic civilization to which everyone belonged. The sense of brotherhood and sisterhood was so much emphasized that it overcame all local attachments to a particular tribe, race, or language--all of which became subservient to the universal brotherhood and sisterhood of Islam.The global civilization thus created by Islam permitted people of diverse ethnic backgrounds to work together in cultivating various arts and sciences. Although the civilization was profoundly Islamic, even non-Muslim \"people of the book\" participated in the intellectual activity whose fruits belonged to everyone. The scientific climate was reminiscent of the present situation in America where scientists and men and women of learning from all over the world are active in the advancement of knowledge which belongs to everyone.The global civilization created by Islam also succeeded in activating the mind and thought of the people who entered its fold. As a result of Islam, the nomadic Arabs became torch-bearers of science and learning. The Persians who had created a great civilization before the rise of Islam nevertheless produced much more science and learning in the Islamic period than before. The same can be said of the Turks and other peoples who embraced Islam. The religion of Islam was itself responsible not only for the creation of a world civilization in which people of many different ethnic backgrounds participated, but it played a central role in developing intellectual and cultural life on a scale not seen before. For some eight hundred years Arabic remained the major intellectual and scientific language of the world. During the centuries following the rise of Islam, Muslim dynasties ruling in various parts of the Islamic world bore witness to the flowering of Islamic culture and thought. In fact this tradition of intellectual activity was eclipsed only at the beginning of modern times as a result of the weakening of faith among Muslims combined with external domination. And today this activity has begun anew in many parts of the Islamic world now that the Muslims have regained their political independence.

[1]\r\n\r\nWhen He uses nahnu to refer to Himself, nahnu is the royal we, and connotes majesty. Someone steeped in the Quranic language will feel humbled before the divine majesty when reciting such verses. This humbleness is the essence of worship, which defines the relationship between servant and Master. Verses that speak of resurrection and judgment, for example, have a powerful aura of divine majesty. In one such passage, Allah Most High says,\r\n\r\n\"The Day when the Trumpet will be sounded: that Day, We shall gather the sinful, blear-eyed (with terror). In whispers will they consult each other: \'You tarried not longer than ten (days).\'\"\r\n\r\nThe next verse uses the royal we to continue this scene of divine majesty, saying, \"nahnu a`lamu bi ma yaquluna idh  yaqulu amthaluhum tariqatan in labithtum illa yawma.\", meaning, \" We know very well what they say, when the best of them in his ways will say, “You did not remain more than one day.”\"','Why-does-Allah-refer-to-Himself-with-the-plural-pro-32',0),(33,'Qibla > Answers > Guidance & Counsel > Beliefs (Aqida) > Allah > Can I tell my five year old daughter that Allah is her best friend?

This will inculcate the love of Allah in our children\'s hearts and sow the seeds for lives of obedience and righteousness, insha\'Allah.\r\n\r\nAnd Allah knows best.','Qibla-Answers-Guidance-and-Counsel-Beliefs-Aqi-33',0),(34,'Why Does Allah Test Us?','42:11',10,'2012-03-07 07:11:11','2012-03-07 07:11:11','4283','A fundamental tenet of our belief is that Allah is completely dissimilar to everything besides Him. He tells us in the Qur\'an, \"There is nothing whatsoever like unto Him.\" A consequence of this belief is that unlike human actions, divine actions are not driven by motives, because motives only make sense in the context of someone who is weak and needy.\r\n\r\nTo clarify this further, consider the following. When humans perform actions, it makes sense to inquire what drove them to do so because, being the indigent beings that they are, they always act to fulfill certain needs. For example, Zayd will put on a coat because the weather is cold and he needs warmth. Aisha will eat food because she is hungry and needs nutrition. Ali will go to university because he needs to earn a living through the degree that he will obtain. As you can see from these examples, the motives that people have behind their actions betray their fundamental neediness.\r\n\r\nAllah is the creator of everything and needs nothing. This is easy to state but not so straightforward to comprehend. One of the implications of this absolute freedom from need of anything is that Allah is not driven by motives when He acts. Someone who needs nothing can have no motives. To ask \"why\" Allah did something makes no sense at all. In the words of the Qur\'an, \"He is not questioned regarding what He does, but they are questioned.\"\r\n\r\nAllah has no need for our obedience and our disobedience does not harm Him. He does not need to reward us if we obey Him. And had He chosen to, He could have rewarded us for disobeying Him. This is why classical manuals of orthodox Sunni belief teach us that whenever Allah rewards someone, He does so out of His pure generosity; not because He is driven to do so by a need or because we have a right to His reward. The question, \"Why?\" is inapplicable.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Allah does not need to punish us if we disobey Him. And had He chosen to, He could have punished us for obeying Him. This is why the same manuals also teach us that whenever Allah punishes someone, He is not wronging them, for they have no right over Him (recall that our obedience or disobedience does not affect Him). He punishes out of His pure justice. The question, \"Why?\" is inapplicable.\r\n\r\nQur\'anic verses that seem to imply motives\r\n\r\nThis is the backdrop against which we understand statements that seem to imply that Allah did a certain act for some reason. For example, when the Qur\'an tells us that He created us to worship Him, this does not mean that He needed to be worshipped and therefore created us to fulfill this need. Instead, what He is telling us is that he created us with the capability to worship Him by giving us the ability to choose our actions (Hashiyat al-Jamal `ala al-Jalalayn).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, when Allah tells us that He created us to test us, this does not mean that He needs to test us in order to find out whether we will do good or evil. He already knows what we will do. Rather, our playing out the actions of this life is merely a proof for or against us on the Day of Judgment.\r\n\r\nThe Practical Upshot\r\n\r\nAllah created us and decreed that those of us who choose the actions of the people of Paradise will enter Paradise and those who choose the actions of the people of the Fire will enter the Fire. Because Allah is completely unlike everything else that exists, it does not make sense to ask why He did this. Rather, this is just how things are, and it is up to us to choose where we want to go.\r\n\r\nIn reality, the entire Sacred Law is a tremendous blessing for us in this life and the next. Obligations that initially seem difficult to fulfill have a polishing effect on the heart until eventually the one\'s entire perspective changes. Outward submission leads to inward submission and heart fills with love and gratitude for Allah. Obligations are not meant to be hammered out reluctantly; they are meant to be offered in the spirit of heartfelt gratitude to Allah for the myriad blessings that each of us has been given. Someone who is realized in this state will do everything for Allah; \"worldly\" activities such as eating, drinking, and conversing with friends are all performed with the intention of drawing closer to Allah. Such a person will not worry over possible future problems, nor will he grieve over past difficulties, for he is busy with the One he loves. This is true happiness and anyone who misses out on it will never know the meaning of contentment. ','Why-Does-Allah-Test-Us-34',0),(35,'Magnis enim et hac tortor ultrices nisi pulvinar, tortor!

Who is he, whom they seek to worship?\r\n\r\nIn his struggle against heathen polytheism in Mecca and its surroundings, Muhammad waged a merciless campaign against all gods, idols and images. He stubbornly taught: \"Allah is One! All other gods are nothing!\" He had accepted this basic monotheistic faith of the Jews who were living in the Arabian Peninsula because they had been exiled from their homeland by the Romans. Influenced by them, Muhammad freed the Arab world from idolatry in line with what the Old Testament prophets had demanded (Sura al-Ikhlas 112:1-5).\r\n\r\nThe first half of the Islamic creed makes a sharp distinction between the Oneness of God and the claims of religions and magical cults which teach that other gods exist besides Allah. Millions of Muslims daily confess, \"There is no God but Allah!\" This testimony is the very core of the Islamic faith. Whoever does not assent unconditionally to this dogma is considered by Muslims a godless idolater. Every theological assertion that does not submit to this principle is rejected without question.\r\n\r\nMuhammad did not merely testify to the uniqueness of Allah, but also described him with a variety of names. The Islamic theologians have systematised all statements of the Qur\'an about Allah, including his attributes and acts, into \"the 99 most beautiful names of Allah\". The names do not occur in equal frequency in the Qur\'an. Several are mentioned a hundred times, others once or twice, and some are found only implicitly as we read between the lines. All Arabic adjectives can be understood as nouns, so that in the Qur\'an every attribute of Allah simultaneously expresses one of his names.\r\n\r\nWhoever painstakingly attempts to sort through these names of Allah according to their significance and frequency moves closer to the realm of Muhammad\'s thoughts and ideas.\r\n\r\nAllah is the Omniscient One with infinite wisdom. He hears all and sees all. He understands all and encompasses everything.\r\n\r\nHe is Omnipotent and his strength is unlimited, powerful enough to both build up and to destroy.\r\n\r\nTherefore, he is the sublime and exalted one above everything, great and immeasurable, magnificent and almighty. No one is equal to him.\r\n\r\nHe is the living one, every existing, unending, everlasting, eternal, the first and the last, the one and the only one, the incomparably beautiful one.\r\n\r\nThus he is praiseworthy and excellent, the holy one, light and peace. He is the true reality and the foundation of everything.\r\n\r\nAllah is the one who created everything out of nothing by the strength of his word. He brought everything into being, and to him we shall all return. He creates life and causes death (Sura al-A`raf 7:44). He will raise the dead and unite the universe.\r\n\r\nTherefore, he is the sovereign lord and king to whom the universe belongs. He exalts and he abases. He is the defender and the destroyer. He is the guide and the tempter. He saves whom he wills and condemns whom he wishes (Suras al-A`raf 7:44, al-Anfal 8:27, al-Nahl 16:35, al-Insan 76:32).\r\n\r\nAbove all this, he is called the compassionate and merciful one, and yet he is also the avenger. He has recorded everything precisely and will be the incorruptible and indisputable witness on the day of judgement. He is the best of all judges and will present each man with an exact bill of reckoning.\r\n\r\nHis overwhelming authority may open the door to success or hinder the progress of an event. He has everything and everyone in his hand. He opens and closes the doors. Nothing takes place without his will. He does not need a mediator. Everything depends directly on him.\r\n\r\nHe is also benevolent and patient, faithful and kind to the Muslims. He is the generous giver of all gifts and abilities. From him alone comes provision for all mankind. He who possesses everything makes people wealthy and protects all who glorify him. He is favourable to them and will be a guardian over all who worship him.\r\n\r\nHe acknowledges those who repent, and forgives because he is the forgiving one. He is gracious toward the Muslims and establishes a good relationship with them. But no Muslim can be certain whether the good attributes of Allah are directed toward him personally, or whether Allah\'s harsh and devastating side will eventually strike him. Often, the names of Allah are merely ascribed to him by believers in wishful thinking rather than as certainties. His more oppressive and frightening attributes create fear in people and drive them to do everything possible to keep the law. Poverty and illness are regarded as signs of Allah\'s wrath for their hidden sins. By the same token, riches, success and people\'s esteem in the Muslim society are taken as indications of favour from the One who alone makes rich, and who honours his worshippers with blessings. Some Muslims today say, \"Because we have remained faithful to Allah for 1,300 years, he has rewarded us with the oil.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we turn away from all such confusing and frustrating names of Allah and ask an ordinary Muslim, \"Tell me, who is your God? What do you think and feel, when you hear the name of Allah?\" He may possibly smile, spread out his arms and only say \"ALLAH!\" This means: Allah cannot be proved or described. One can only sense him and know about his existence. And then perhaps he may confirm this intuitive understanding with the phrase, \"Allahu akbar!\"\r\n\r\nIn this statement we have the abridged form of the Islamic creed, which is on the lips of millions many times a day. With this testimony Khomeini\'s revolutionary guards ran blindly into mine fields knowing they will be torn to shreds. From the loudspeakers of the minarets these words are repeated forty times a day over shops, homes, schools, factories and government buildings. Yet this phrase is not complete in itself, but is only a portion of a sentence. It does not mean, as it is sometimes translated, \"Allah is great\" or \"Allah is the greatest.\" Its literal meaning is \"Allah is greater!\" Every listener should then, albeit unconsciously, complete the thought: Allah is wiser than all philosophers, more beautiful than the most fascinating view, stronger than all atomic and hydrogen bombs together, and greater than anything we know. Allah is the unique, unexplorable and inexplicable one - the remote, vast and unknown God. Everything we may think about him is incomplete, if not wrong. Allah cannot be comprehended. He comprehends us. We are slaves who have only the privilege to worship him in fear.\r\n\r\nIslam stands for a renunciation of the rationalism that prevails in Europe and America. For a long time it was one of the characteristics of Islamic theology that Allah could not be described philosophically. There was not even a desire to comprehend him and to fathom his being (Sura al-Ra`d 13:13).\r\n\r\nUnderstanding this brings us to a crucial statement, expressed by the Islamic theologian al-Ghazali. He had meditated a great deal on \"the 99 excellent names of God\". He wrote that these names can mean everything and yet nothing. One name of Allah can negate another and the content of one may be included in the next. No one can understand Allah. Devout believers therefore can only worship this unknown, superdimensional God and live before him in fear and reverence, observing all his laws in strict obedience.','THE-99-NAMES-OF-ALLAH',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10,'Allah the Creator',9,'2012-02-09 14:49:20','2012-03-07 06:05:13','\"Have not those who disbelieve known that the heavens and the earth were of one piece, then We parted them, and We made every living thing from water?

In the course of this liturgy, a Muslim will prostrate himself before Allah up to 34 times a day. Anyone who has seen a Muslim prostrating is impressed. The curve of his bent back during prayer is the best commentary on the word \"ISLAM\" which translated means surrender, submission or subjugation. These words sound very pious and describe the total submission of a Muslim to Allah.\r\n\r\nAny observer who considers this will realise that anyone who prostrates himself before Allah 34 times a day in worship is not a free or person. He is no longer himself because his entire way of living and thinking is fully guided and influenced by Allah. In fact, the Arabic words for a religious service, place of worship and worshipper are derived from the word for slaves. According to Islam, everyone is a slave to Allah. No one is free. No one lives for himself. Everyone belongs to his Creator and was created to worship and to serve perpetually and unconditionally.\r\n\r\nIf it were possible to take a spaceship and fly high above the earth and observe mankind with a powerful telescope, we could see the prayer ritual of Islam sweeping across our globe like a mighty wave five times a day as millions of Muslims bow to the ground in worship.\r\n\r\nAt dawn, as soon as one can distinguish between a white and a black thread, the prayer of the Muslim begins in the Philippines. The first wave of worship surges over Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, India, then Iran and Turkey. Finally it reaches Europe, at which time the second wave of worship begins at noon for the Muslims in China. This new wave will have reached India and the 45 million Muslims in Central Asia just as a third wave will have started at 3 p.m. for afternoon prayers in the Far East. These three waves of worship follow each other successively, moulding and determining life under the Islamic culture. At this time, as dawn is breaking on the east coast of America with its morning prayer, Muslims in the Nile Valley are bowing down in the heat of their noon prayer and in Pakistan men are gathering in their mosques for afternoon prayer. When the final wave of the Muslim night prayer begins in the Far East two hours after sunset, simultaneously the rays of the setting sun touch the worshippers in the Ganges Delta, while pilgrims in Mecca bow down for afternoon prayer before the black stone in the Ka\'ba. At that moment the second prayer wave has already reached faithful Muslims in the high Atlas Mountains in Morocco, while the first waves breaks with the early morning dawn in the Rocky Mountains of America.\r\n\r\nThese five prayer waves unite millions of Muslims in worship of their God. Islam is a religion of adoration and worship. Many Muslims pray earnestly and with great reverence, disciplining themselves by repeating their liturgical prayers 17 times a day.\r\n\r\nVery early in the morning, the muezzins call from the minarets of the mosques, often through loudspeakers, over the roofs of the houses to all the people: \"Arise to prayer! Arise to success! Prayer is better then sleep!\"\r\n\r\nUnless Christians rethink their prayer practices and discipline themselves into regular and intensive prayer for Muslims, they should not be astonished that Islam defies the attempts of mission societies and rises to challenge a tired Christianity.\r\n\r\nThe call from the minaret includes a significant sentence: \"Arise to success!\" Everyone who serves Allah hopes to receive a reward from him. Those who perform the prayers expect to receive earthly and heavenly blessings. Devotion to Allah and obedience to his commands deserve many gifts including salvation. Muslims do not thank Allah because he has already saved them through grace. On the contrary, they feel they must pray and keep the law in order to have the goodwill of Allah bestowed upon them. So Islam is a religion based on self-righteousness in which everyone tries to accumulate good deeds and so establish his own salvation by good works.\r\n\r\nPrayer in Islam is not a voluntary service, but rather a compulsion, an obligation and a law. In Saudi Arabia once can sometimes observe policemen during the prayer times forcing passers-by into the mosques, so that the wrath of Allah may not descend on the country because of neglected prayer. Islam is a religion under the law of Allah. All facets of life are specifically controlled by a multitude of regulations. Allah is the centre of everything.\r\n\r\nThere is a deep longing for purity in Islam. Before each prayer time, every Muslim must follow a compulsory ablution - the washing of hands, arms, feet, mouth, face and even hair. Everyone must be clean before entering Allah\'s presence to pray. Anyone who does not follow the exact cleansing procedure is considered to have nullified his prayers. Christians know that such outward rituals do not cleanse the heart or the mind. But the five-times-daily ablutions in Islam testify to a deep longing for purity on the part of those who pray.\r\n\r\nA sentence in the main prayer for all Muslims - from the al-Fatiha - reads, \"Guide us in the straight path, the path of those whom thou hast blessed, not of those against whom thou art wrathful, nor of those who are astray\" (Sura al-Fatiha 1:2,3). This cry expresses the desire for guidance and a total dependence on Allah. It would be wrong, ignorant and arrogant for Christians to deny the faithful intent of Muslims to serve God. On the contrary, their discipline, sincerity and consistency in praying can be an example to many of us. Without a doubt, every true Muslim desires to serve God with all his heart. He calls on him in his prayers. He wants to honour him; he fights for him and submits his entire being to him. In the Old Testament we read that God hears every honest prayer - even from a Muslim!

It is a religion of worship, of righteousness by good works, and even calls for self-sacrifice in the cause of Allah. Countless Muslims have died in holy wars during the course of history to uphold the name of Allah and carry it into all the world.\r\n\r\nReligious zeal, however, does not save anyone. Rather the gospel teaches us, \"Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God\'s wrath remains on him\" (John 3:36). Islam rejects God\'s Son. Consequently, it puts itself outside of the truth. Islam is not a way that leads to God, because no one comes to the Father, except through Jesus Christ (John 14:6).\r\n\r\nSuch spiritual issues constitute a call for every Christian to serve the Lord among unbelievers, especially the Muslims. Have we become so contented with a Christianity that lives only for itself, that the spiritual destitution of 800 million Muslims fails to arouse us? If you cannot fly to an Islamic country to be a witness for Christ, you can still pray for Muslims and support other brothers and sisters who have been called of the Lord to serve among them. Maybe you can do something for foreign Muslim workers and students in your country. The fact that only a few younger or older Christians are ready to follow the call of Jesus to serve him in world missions should be an alarm signal shaking every church and congregation. Saved believers should have a desire to save others. If there is no sense of urgency for missionary service among the followers of Christ, then the question must be asked whether or not these church members have really experienced a genuine conversion and a Spirit-filled rebirth.\r\n\r\nChrist is on the move even today, seeking to save those who are lost. Is the church abandoning him? Or are some responding with Isaiah, who, after sincere repentance and divine cleansing, said, \"Here am I, send me!\" (Isaiah 6:8)?\r\n\r\nAlongside or within the structure of mission societies and existing indigenous churches, there are today special opportunities for skilled workers, students and tourists to enter closed countries where regular missionary work has not yet been possible.\r\n\r\nFor example, a skilled Christian worker has a golden opportunity to use his skill in some of the oil-producing countries combining it with a wise personal witness. The only question is whether he will seek training and accept the call to be sent by Christ as a witness among Muslims. The skilled workers\' mission represents, in our days, a challenge to every young Christian.\r\n\r\nWhoever wishes to participate in missionary service among Muslims must be aware that the spirit of Islam officially opposes every form of Christian mission. it is forbidden to call Muslims to the crucified Son of God in almost every country where Islam is the state religion. We have to realise that Islam is not only a religion, but a culture, and sometimes a state. Anyone witnessing to Muslims in an Islamic country is regarded as committing an offence against the government and must sometimes face punishment. But we must obey God rather than man.\r\n\r\nIn our days the mission field has come to our homelands. Over 10 million Muslims live, work or study in Europe and over 2 million in North America. Who will speak with them about Christ? Who will give them wise guidance through their practical problems? Who will invite them for supper or tea? How often do we pray for the foreign workers and students? We love them only insofar as we pray for them! Those who do not understand their languages can acquire literature and cassettes from various centres to give to them.\r\n\r\nEveryone who is ready to serve Muslims in Jesus\' name will soon find that a long-time rejection of the Gospel has hardened their hearts. Muslims are conditioned and immunised from childhood against faith in the true Christ. The rejecting spirit of Islam holds them captive in a collective grip. No Muslim can come to a genuine conversion without the direct intervention of Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\nIn the world of Islam we find a mission field markedly different from those countries where the message of Christ had not been proclaimed prior to the establishment of the particular religions or cults in those countries. Therefore, it is imperative for a convert from Islam to detach himself from the spirit of Islam, together with its practices, and to fall in love with Christ. If he will not deny himself and depart from Islam willingly, he will suffer from spiritual schizophrenia that will sooner or later draw him back into Islam.\r\n\r\nEvery Christian who wants to serve among Muslims must first examine himself to discern if the Lord has called him personally to this service. Romantic enthusiasm does not motivate for long. \"Our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers and the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms\" (Ephesians 6:12). Only Jesus is our protection and our strength. He alone produces lasting fruit. Every missionary among Muslims should therefore surrender and submit himself in a complete consecration to the crucified Christ, who leads dedicated people in the way and to the places He chooses. The spirit of a self-satisfied and traditional Christianity must be relinquished through obedience to the Spirit of Christ by missionaries among Muslims. They must be no longer hold on to their rights, but only accept their duties, just as the Lord said, \"I did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give my life as a ransom for many\" (Matthew 20:28).','Islam-a-Collective-Bondage',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(23,'Muhammad (610–632)',17,'2012-03-07 06:32:00','2012-03-07 06:32:00','Muhammad (c. 570 – June 8, 632) was a trader later becoming a religious, political, and military leader. However, Muslims do not view Muhammad as the creator of Islam, but instead regard him as the last messenger of God, through which the Qur\'an was revealed. Muslims view Muhammad as the restorer of the original, uncorrupted monotheistic faith of Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and other prophets. In Muslim tradition, Muhammad is viewed as the last in a series of prophets.[86] During the last 22 years of his life, beginning at age 40 in 610 CE, according to the earliest surviving biographies, Muhammad reported revelations that he believed to be from God. The content of these revelations, known as the Qur\'an, was memorized and recorded by his companions.[87] During this time, Muhammad preached to the people of Mecca, imploring them to abandon polytheism. Although some converted to Islam, Muhammad and his followers were persecuted by the leading Meccan authorities. After 12 years of preaching, Muhammad and the Muslims performed the Hijra (\"emigration\") to the city of Medina (formerly known as Yathrib) in 622, after initially trying the Ethiopian Aksumite Empire. There, with the Medinan converts (Ansar) and the Meccan migrants (Muhajirun), Muhammad established his political and religious authority. Within years, two battles had been fought against Meccan forces: the Battle of Badr in 624, which was a Muslim victory, and the Battle of Uhud in 625, which ended inconclusively. Conflict with Medinan Jewish clans who opposed the Muslims led to their exile, enslavement, or death, and the Jewish enclave of Khaybar was subdued. In 628, the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah was signed between Mecca and the Muslims and was broken by Mecca two years later. At the same time, Meccan trade routes were cut off as Muhammad brought surrounding desert tribes under his control.[88] By 629 Muhammad was victorious in the nearly bloodless Conquest of Mecca, and by the time of his death in 632 (at the age of 62) he united the tribes of Arabia into a single religious polity.[89]','Muhammad-610-632',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(24,'Caliphate and Sunni-Shia split (632–750)',17,'2012-03-07 06:33:02','2012-03-07 06:33:02','With Muhammad\'s death in 632, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. Umar ibn al-Khattab, a prominent companion of Muhammad, nominated Abu Bakr, who was Muhammad\'s companion and close friend. Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first caliph. Abu Bakr\'s immediate task was to avenge a recent defeat by Byzantine forces, although he first had to put down a rebellion by Arab tribes in an episode known as the Ridda wars, or \"Wars of Apostasy\".[90]\r\nThe Great Mosque of Kairouan, established in 670 in Kairouan, Tunisia, represents one of the best architectural examples of Islamic civilization.[91]\r\n\r\nHis death in 634 resulted in the succession of Umar as the caliph, followed by Uthman ibn al-Affan, Ali ibn Abi Talib and Hasan ibn Ali. The first caliphs are known as al-khulafā\' ar-rāshidūn (\"Rightly Guided Caliphs\"). Under them, the territory under Muslim rule expanded deeply into Persian and Byzantine territories.[92] When Umar was assassinated in 644, the election of Uthman as successor was met with increasing opposition. In 656, Uthman was also killed, and Ali assumed the position of caliph. After fighting off opposition in the first civil war (the \"First Fitna\"), Ali was assassinated by Kharijites in 661. Following this, Mu\'awiyah seized power and began the Umayyad dynasty, with its capital in Damascus.[93]\r\n\r\nThese disputes over religious and political leadership would give rise to schism in the Muslim community. The majority accepted the legitimacy of the three rulers prior to Ali, and became known as Sunnis. A minority disagreed, and believed that Ali was the only rightful successor; they became known as the Shi\'a.[94] After Mu\'awiyah\'s death in 680, conflict over succession broke out again in a civil war known as the \"Second Fitna\". The Umayyad dynasty conquered the Maghrib, the Iberian Peninsula, Narbonnese Gaul and Sindh.[95] The local population of Jews and indigenous Christians, persecuted as religious minorities and taxed heavily, often aided Muslims to take over their lands from the Byzantines and Persians, resulting in exceptionally speedy conquests.[96][97]\r\n\r\nThe Umayyad aristocracy viewed Islam as a religion for Arabs only;[98] the economy of the Umayyad empire was based on the assumption that a majority of non-Muslims (Dhimmis) would pay taxes to the minority of Muslim Arabs. A non-Arab who wanted to convert to Islam was supposed to first become a client of an Arab tribe. Even after conversion, these new Muslims (mawali) did not achieve social and economic equality with the Arabs. The descendants of Muhammad\'s uncle Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib rallied discontented mawali, poor Arabs, and some Shi\'a against the Umayyads and overthrew them with the help of the general Abu Muslim, inaugurating the Abbasid dynasty in 750 and moved the capital to Baghdad.[99]','Caliphate-and-Sunni-Shia-split-632-750',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(25,'Abbasid era (750–1258)',17,'2012-03-07 06:33:43','2012-03-07 06:33:43','Expansion of the Muslim world continued by both conquest and proselytism as both Islam and Muslim trade networks were extending into sub-Saharan West Africa, Central Asia, Volga Bulgaria and the Malay archipelago.[100] The Ghaznavids and Ghurids conquered much of the Indian subcontinent. Many Muslims went to China to trade, virtually dominating the import and export industry of the Song Dynasty.[101]\r\n\r\nThe major hadith collections were compiled. The Ja\'fari jurisprudence was formed from the teachings of Ja\'far al-Sadiq while the four Sunni Madh\'habs, the Hanafi, Hanbali, Maliki and Shafi\'i, were established around the teachings of Abū Ḥanīfa, Ahmad bin Hanbal, Malik ibn Anas and al-Shafi\'i respectively. Al-Shafi\'i also codified a method to establish the reliability of hadith.[102] Al-Tabari and Ibn Kathir completed the most commonly cited commentaries on the Quran, the Tafsir al-Tabari in the 9th century and the Tafsir ibn Kathir in the 14th century, respectively. Philosophers Al-Farabi and Ibn Sina (Avicenna) sought to incorporate Greek principles into Islamic theology, while others like Al-Ghazzali argued against them and ultimately prevailed.[103]\r\n\r\nCaliphs such as Mamun al Rashid and Al-Mu\'tasim made the mutazilite philosophy an official creed and imposed it upon Muslims to follow. Mu\'tazila was a Greek influenced school of speculative theology called kalam, which refers to dialectic.[104] Many orthodox Muslims rejected mutazilite doctrines and condemned their idea of the creation of the Quran. In inquisitions, Imam Hanbal refused to conform and was tortured and sent to a unlit Baghdad prison cell for nearly thirty months.[105] The other branch of kalam was the Ash\'ari school founded by Al-Ash\'ari. Some Muslims began to question the piety of indulgence in a worldly life and emphasized poverty, humility and avoidance of sin based on renunciation of bodily desires. Ascetics such as Hasan al-Basri would inspire a movement that would evolve into Sufism.[106] Beginning in the 13th century, Sufism underwent a transformation, largely because of efforts to legitimize and reorganize the movement by Al-Ghazali, who developed the model of the Sufi order—a community of spiritual teachers and students.[107]\r\n\r\nIslamic civilization flourished in what is sometimes referred to as the \"Islamic Golden Age\".[108] Public hospitals established during this time (called Bimaristan hospitals), are considered \"the first hospitals\" in the modern sense of the word,[109][110] and issued the first medical diplomas to license doctors of medicine.[111][112] The Guinness World Records recognizes the University of Al Karaouine, founded in 859, as the world\'s oldest degree-granting university.[113] The doctorate is argued to date back to the licenses to teach in law schools.[114] Standards of experimental and quantification techniques, as well as the tradition of citation,[115] were introduced to the scientific process.[116] An important pioneer in this, Ibn Al-Haytham is regarded as the father of the modern scientific method and often referred to as the \"world’s first true scientist.\"[117][118] The government paid scientists the equivalent salary of professional athletes today.[115] Discoveries include gathering the data used by Copernicus for his heliocentric conclusions and Al-Jahiz’s proposal of the theory of natural selection.[119][120] Rumi wrote some of the finest Persian poetry and is still one of the best selling poets in America.[121][122] Legal institutions introduced include the trust and charitable trust (Waqf).[123][124]\r\n\r\nThe first Muslims states independent of a unified Muslim state emerged from the Berber Revolt (739/740-743). In 836, the capital was moved to Samarra by Caliph Al-Mu\'tasim and it was returned to Baghdad in 892. In 930, the Ismaili group known as the Qarmatians unsuccessfully rebelled against the Abbassids, sacked Mecca and stole the Black Stone.[125] By 1055 the Seljuq Turks had eliminated the Abbasids as a military power but continued the caliph\'s titular authority.[126] The Mongol Empire finally put an end to the Abbassid dynasty, killing its last Caliph at the Battle of Baghdad in 1258.','Abbasid-era-750-1258',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(26,'Fall of Abbasids to end of caliphate (1258–1924)',17,'2012-03-07 06:34:25','2012-03-07 06:34:25','Expansion continued with independent powers moving into new areas. An alliance of European Christian kingdoms mobilized to launch a series of wars, known as the Crusades, aimed at capturing the Holy Land, though initially successful, was reversed by subsequent Muslim generals such as Saladin, who recaptured Jerusalem in 1187.[127] In Europe, the Crimean Khanate was one of the strongest regional powers in Europe until the end of the 17th century.[128] In the 13th and 14th centuries the Ottoman Empire conquered the Balkans, parts of Greece, Constantinople[129] and reached as far as the gates of Vienna in 1529.[130] Under Ottoman rule, many people in the Balkans became Muslim.\r\nThe Sultan Ahmet Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey, was built during the Ottoman Empire.\r\n\r\nWhile cultural styles used to radiate from Baghdad, the Mongol destruction of Baghdad led Egypt to become the Arab heartland while Central Asia went its own way and was experiencing another golden age. The Safavid dynasty of Persia made ties with India and Persian poetry rose to new heights while Arabic poetry was in state of decline. The Muslims in China who were descended from earlier immigration began to assimilate by adopting Chinese names and culture while Nanjing became an important center of Islamic study.[131][132]\r\n\r\nThe Muslim world was generally in political decline, especially relative to the non-Islamic European powers. Large areas of Islamic Central Asia were seriously depopulated largely as a result of Mongol destruction.[133] The Black Death ravaged much of the Islamic world in the mid-14th century.[134][135] This decline was evident culturally; while Taqi al-Din founded an observatory in Istanbul and the Jai Singh Observatory was built in the 18th century, there was not a single Muslim country with a major observatory by the twentieth century.[136] The Reconquista, launched against Muslim principalities in Iberia, succeeded in 1492 and Muslim Italian states were lost to the Normans. By the 19th century the British Empire had formally ended the last Mughal dynasty.[137] The Ottoman era ended after World War I and the Caliphate was abolished in 1924.[138][139]\r\n\r\nReform and revival movements during this period include an 18th century Salafi movement led by Ibn Abd al-Wahhab in today\'s Saudi Arabia. Referred to as Wahhabi, their self designation is Muwahiddun (unitarians). Building upon earlier efforts such as those by the logician Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn al-Qayyim, the movement seeks to uphold monotheism and purify Islam of later innovations. Their zeal against idolatrous shrines led to the destruction of sacred tombs in Mecca and Medina, including those of the Prophet and his Companions.[140] In the 19th century, the Deobandi and Barelwi movements were initiated.','Fall-of-Abbasids-to-end-of-caliphate-1258-1924',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(27,'Modern times (1924–present)',17,'2012-03-07 06:35:09','2012-03-07 06:35:09','Contact with industrialized nations brought Muslim populations to new areas through economic migration. Many Muslims migrated as indentured servants, from mostly India and Indonesia, to the Caribbean, forming the largest Muslim populations by percentage in the Americas.[141] The resulting urbanization and increase in trade in sub-Saharan Africa brought Muslims to settle in new areas and spread their faith, likely doubling the Muslims population between 1869 and 1914.[142] Muslim immigrants, many as guest workers, began arriving, largely from former colonies, into several European nations in the 1960s and 1970s, particularly France and the UK.\r\nNational Mosque of Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur.\r\nCompleted in 1984, the Abuja mosque is the national mosque of Nigeria.\r\nA mosque in the Roxbury section of Boston, Massachusetts, in the United States.\r\n\r\nNew Muslim intellectuals are beginning to arise, and are increasingly separating perennial Islamic beliefs from archaic cultural traditions.[143] Liberal Islam is a movement that attempts to reconcile religious tradition with modern norms of secular governance and human rights. Its supporters say that there are multiple ways to read Islam\'s sacred texts, and stress the need to leave room for \"independent thought on religious matters\".[144] Women\'s issues receive a significant weight in the modern discourse on Islam because the family structure remains central to Muslim identity.[145] Also of issue is the assimilation of Muslim communities and Islamophobia in host countries.[146] Andrew Rippin states that while Muslims believe that Islam stands for both men and women, the social reality suggests otherwise.[145] Christopher Hitchens states that Islam is \"dogmatic,\" and \"the fact remains that Islam\'s core claim – to be unimprovable and final – is at once absurd.\" Such claims have been challenged by many Muslim scholars and writers including Fazlur Rahman Malik,[147] Syed Ameer Ali,[148] Ahmed Deedat,[149] Yusuf Estes and Tariq Ramadan.\r\n\r\nSecular powers such as Chinese Red Guards closed many mosques and destroyed Qurans and Communist Albania became the first country to ban the practice of every religion.[150][151] In Turkey, the military carried out coups to oust Islamist governments and headscarves were, as well as in Tunisia, banned in official buildings.[152][153] About half a million Muslims were killed in Cambodia by communists whom, it is argued, viewed them as their primary enemy and wished to exterminate them since they stood out and worshipped their own god.[154] However, Islamist groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood advocate Islam as a comprehensive political solution, often in spite of being banned.[155] Jamal-al-Din al-Afghani, along with his acolyte Muhammad Abduh, have been credited as forerunners of the Islamic revival.[156] In Iran, revolution replaced secular regime with an Islamic state. In Turkey, the Islamist AK Party has democratically been in power for about a decade, while Islamist parties are doing well in elections following the Arab spring.[157] The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), consisting of Muslim countries, was established in 1969 after the burning of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.[158]\r\n\r\nPiety appears to be deepening worldwide.[159][160][161] Orthodox groups are sometimes well funded and are growing at the expense of traditional groups.[162] In many places, the prevalence of the Islamic veil is growing increasingly common [163] and the percentage of Muslims favoring Sharia laws has increased.[164] With religious guidance increasingly available electronically, Muslims are able to access views that are strict enough for them rather than rely state clerics who are often seen as stooges.[160] Some organizations began using the media to promote Islam such as the 24-hour TV channel, Peace TV.[165] Perhaps as a result of these efforts, most experts agree that Islam is growing faster than any other faith in East and West Africa.[166][167]','Modern-times-1924-present',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

If you pick up an Arabic Bible, you will see the word \"Allah\" being used where \"God\" is used in English. This is because \"Allah\" is the only word in the Arabic language equivalent to the English word \"God\" with a capital \"G\". Additionally, the word \"Allah\" cannot be made plural or given gender (i.e. masculine or feminine), which goes hand-in-hand with the Islamic concept of God. Because of this, and also because the Qur\'an, which is the holy scripture of Muslims, was revealed in the Arabic language, some Muslims use the word \"Allah\" for \"God\", even when they are speaking other languages. This is not unique to the word \"Allah\", since many Muslims tend to use Arabic words when discussing Islamic issues, regardless of the language that they speak. This is because the universal teachings of Islam - even though they have been translated in every major language - have been preserved in the Arabic language.

Only a few Westerners in distant colonies had been exposed to Muslims. Some romantic tales about the Turkish wars survived. However, the rapid technological developments in the West had by-passed the Islamic peoples, making them appear insignificant.\r\n\r\nBut not much time has passed since Europe was last in danger of being overrun by Islam. In the year 1453 Constantinople, the Eastern bulwark of Christianity, was captured by the Ottomans. Later in 1529 and again in 1683 the Turks stood at the gates of Vienna. The struggle to free Belgrade lasted almost 200 years; and it was only a short time before the First World War when the last Balkan countries were able to shake off the Islamic Turkish yoke. For 600 years Islam and Christianity have wrestled with each other in that area.\r\n\r\nMany Christians have forgotten that Syria and North Africa were once the heartland of the Christian world! But during the first Islamic invasions in the years AD 632 to 732 they were overrun and fell under Arab control. Muslim armies swept into Western Europe and stood no more than 200 kilometres south of Paris, and near Geneva, too. If Charles Martel had not stood firm we would likely all be Muslims today! Nietzsche, the atheist, ventured to say sarcastically, \"The greatest mistake in world history was the defeat of the Arabs at Tours and Poitiers.\"\r\n\r\nThe third great attack by Islam began on October 17, 1973, during the Yom Kippur War against Israel, when the Arab kings and sheikhs suddenly quadrupled the price of oil. Since then oil has become an expensive commodity. Its price is one of the main reasons for the economic crises that are currently shaking the world from east to west, to such an extent that some countries, especially in the Third World, are almost strangled by debts. Events in the Near East are no longer absent from the daily television news programs. Islam is building a power potential on all five continents with its oil and financial weapons. This world religion is closing in on Europe and the USA, and looking hungrily at the masses in Asia and Africa.\r\n\r\nSome Christians are slowly beginning to ponder the question \"What is Islam and who is Allah?\" A vast ignorance prevails in this sphere. Humanists try to solve the problem superficially with well-meaning programmes, dialogues and suggestions, but they are not getting to the root of the problem.\r\n\r\nToday, there are more than ten million Muslims living, working and studying in Europe. Several million Muslims have also poured into North America. This means a double challenge for all followers of Christ! First, the \"mission field\" has entered our home countries. Secondly, we must recognise that Islam has a set goal to make the whole world Muslim. For these reasons, it is essential for every Christian to consider seriously the following questions: What are the aims of Islam? Who is Allah? What relationship does Allah have to Jesus Christ and his Church?','Islam-The-World-Power-of-The-future','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17,'History of Islam','2012-03-07 06:31:19','2012-03-07 06:31:19','In sub topics you will find the important parts of history of Islam','History-of-Islam','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);
